# Pycuda_101

Fundamentals of pycuda
The PyCUDA Basic Operations notebook provides an introduction to using PyCUDA, a Python library for using the CUDA framework on NVIDIA GPUs. In this notebook, you will learn how to:

- Install PyCUDA
- Use PyCUDA to write GPU-accelerated programs
- To use PyCUDA, you must first have an NVIDIA GPU and the CUDA framework installed. Then, you can install PyCUDA using the Python package manager pip:

```bash
pip install pycuda
```

Once PyCUDA is installed, you can import it in your Python programs like so:

```python
import pycuda.autoinit
import pycuda.driver as cuda
```
To write GPU-accelerated programs with PyCUDA, you will follow these steps:
- Create a CUDA kernel (a program for the GPU)
- Prepare data for the kernel to operate on
- Run the kernel on the GPU
- Copy the results back to the CPU memory
